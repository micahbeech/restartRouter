# Restart Router App
Every get tired of unreliable wifi? This app resets my router automatically every day at 4 am. :clock4:

The bulk of the app is in [routerReset.py](Contents/routerReset.py), but I wrapped it in a Mac App so I could run it automatically.

The script makes use of the UI for my router, so it likely wouldn't work for a different internet setup. However, the idea is simple and it wouldn't take much work to personalize it! :computer:
