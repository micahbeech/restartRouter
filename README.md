# Restart Router App
Every get tired of unreliable wifi? This app resets my router automatically every day at 4 am. :clock4:

The bulk of the app is in [routerReset.py](Contents/routerReset.py), but I wrapped it in a Mac App so I could run it automatically.

The way the script is written it will only run on my laptop, but it the idea is simple and it wouldn't take much work to make it work on your computer! :computer:
